 odt_templater
===============
---------------------------------------------
 a simple Open Document Text templating tool
---------------------------------------------

This is a minimal module for creating ODT files based on ODT templates and
dictionaries of values.
    
Note that the template rendering is based on regular expression matches on
the ODT internal XML data; as such it should not be considered robust and
will most certainly fail on some inputs. However, it's "good enough" to be
very useful considering the tiny code footprint - there are more lines of
documentation than code here!
    
Just be sure to test your templates...
    
Example:::
    
    from odt_template import render_odt_template

    # Assuming a template that has:
    #   - A @TO@ marker somewhere on the page
    #   - A table with a row containing @CHILD@ and @NAUGHTY@ markers
    #   - An embedded image named XMAS.png
    #
    render_odt_template('xmas-template.odt', 'simpsons-family.odt', {
        'to': 'Santa Claus',
        'child': [
            {'child': 'Bart', 'naughty': 'yes'},
            {'child': 'Lisa', 'naughty': 'no'},
            {'child': 'Maggie', 'naughty': 'no'}
        ],
        'Pictures/XMAS.png': open('pretty-tree.png', 'r').read()
    })
